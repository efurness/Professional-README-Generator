The index.js contains the const variable with input questions containing input, message and name for the sections of the readme.    The Inquirer installation allows the prompts to occur, and the write to file function gets the data from the input into a markdown file which generates the readme. using the function generateMarkdown(data) using template strings to push data from user input.  The user is promted for questions about the project and inputs the results creating the new readme generated each time the node index.js is run.
