# DESCRIPTION 
This is a command line application running on NODE JS and takes user input to generate a README FILE.  The index.js contains the const variable with input questions containing input, message and name for the sections of the readme.  These questions are connected in the generateMarkdown.js file that uses a markdown function to feed the questions in the command line. The results are printed into the Readme file.
